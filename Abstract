Abstract:
In the context of the world health crisis of 2021, cardiovascular diseases are the most
common cause of death worldwide over the last few decades in the developed as well as
underdeveloped and developing countries. Early detection of cardiac diseases and continuous
supervision of clinicians can reduce the mortality rate. However, accurate detection of heart
diseases in all cases and consultation of a patient for 24 hours by a doctor is not available
since it requires more patience, time and expertise. In this study, a tentative design of a cloudbased heart disease prediction system had been proposed to detect impending heart disease
using machine learning techniques. Existing self-diagnosis systems include those attainable
via the internet, which involve entering one's symptoms. There exist several methods, for
example, people read/search medical blogs or notes, which are illuminated wrongly by them,
and they arrive at a completely different presumption regarding the cause of their symptoms.
This study's goal is to join the information required for the person to understand the disease
in adequate detail, with an accurate prediction whether they may have heart disease or not.
The presence of heart disease is predicted using machine learning algorithms such as Support
Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
Trees and Gaussian Naive Bayes. This project evaluates these machine learning algorithms to
obtain the most accurate model, in compliance with Quality of Service (QoS) parameters.
The performance of these machine learning models is scaled and to be compared using the
metrics such as Accuracy, Sensitivity (Recall), Specificity, AUC scores, Execution Time and
Latency.
